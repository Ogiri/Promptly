## üöÄ Project Vision

As large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT and Google's Gemini become core tools for software and data workflows, **crafting effective prompts** remains a key challenge. Promptly empowers developers to:

- Generate multiple candidate prompts from a simple task description
- Rank and evaluate prompts based on quality and token usage
- Log and analyze prompt performance over time
- Integrate with popular LLM APIs out-of-the-box

This makes it easier to iterate, optimize, and automate prompt engineering for real-world projects.
